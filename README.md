# HTOA-optimization-algorithm
 this Algorithm proposes a novel metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by heat transfer relationships based on the second law of thermodynamics. Imitating the heat transfer behavior of solid objects, the proposed method is called the heat transfer relation-based optimization algorithm (HTOA).
